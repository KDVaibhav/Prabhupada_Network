To achieve the desired behavior where the image renders on the right side for large screens and on top of the text and "Donate Now" button for smaller screens, we can adjust the flex direction and layout of the `DonationForm` component. Here's the updated code:

```language:frontend-main/src/components/DonationForm.tsx
// ... existing code ...
const DonationForm = () => {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center justify-center bg-bgApp2 rounded-2xl mb-2">
      <div className="md:w-1/4 flex items-center justify-center order-2 md:order-1">
        <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/opiwak7mf/Prabhupada_Network/donation.png?updatedAt=1751788582838" height={100} width={200} className="rounded-2xl m-5 object-contain"/>
      </div>
      <div className="flex flex-col items-center bg-bgApp2 rounded-2xl mb-2 order-1 md:order-2">
        <div className="p-2 text-center text-fontApp">
          Please Donate And Help Us Organize Srila Prabhupada Connect Days
        </div>
        <Link
          href={"/donation"}
          className="p-2 bg-primary2 rounded-2xl font-bold text-white hover:text-fontApp2"
        >
          Donate Now
        </Link>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
// ... existing code ...
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Flex Direction**:
   - The parent `div` uses `flex-col` (column) by default for smaller screens and switches to `flex-row` (row) for larger screens (`md:flex-row`).

2. **Order Classes**:
   - Added `order-1` and `order-2` to control the stacking order of the elements. On smaller screens, the image (`order-2`) will appear below the text and button (`order-1`). On larger screens (`md:order-1` and `md:order-2`), the image will appear on the right side.

3. **Width Adjustment**:
   - The image container (`md:w-1/4`) ensures the image takes up a quarter of the width on larger screens while maintaining its full width on smaller screens.

This change ensures the layout adapts responsively to different screen sizes.
