# Fixing image rendering in blog content (2025-07-04 12:30Z)

_**User**_

my blog content is
<p>HKHKHKHK</p><p></p>https://ik.imagekit.io/opiwak7mf/blogs/blog-image-1751780889094_X7YKL5Drg>

but when I am trying to render this, it is just rendering it as string, not fetching image from the desired location

_**Assistant**_

The issue you're facing is likely due to the way the HTML content is being rendered in your application. If the content is being treated as a plain string rather than parsed as HTML, the `<img>` tag (or any other HTML tags) won't be rendered as expected. Here's how you can resolve this:

### Solution
1. **Use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (React/Next.js)**:
   If you're using React or Next.js, you can use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to render raw HTML content. However, be cautious as this can expose your application to XSS attacks if the content is not sanitized.

   Example:
   ```tsx
   <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: blogContent }} />
   ```

2. **Sanitize the HTML Content**:
   To mitigate security risks, sanitize the HTML content before rendering it. You can use libraries like `DOMPurify` or `sanitize-html`.

   Example with `DOMPurify`:
   ```tsx
   import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

   const cleanContent = DOMPurify.sanitize(blogContent);
   <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: cleanContent }} />
   ```

3. **Check the Image URL**:
   Ensure the image URL (`https://ik.imagekit.io/opiwak7mf/blogs/blog-image-1751780889094_X7YKL5Drg`) is accessible and correctly formatted. If the URL is broken or the image is not publicly accessible, it won't render.

4. **Debugging**:
   - Log the `blogContent` to verify it contains the correct HTML.
   - Inspect the rendered DOM to see if the `<img>` tag is present but not loading due to a broken URL or other issues.

### Implementation in Your Code
If you're using the `BlogSection.tsx` or similar component, you can update it as follows:

```tsx
// ... existing code ...
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

const BlogSection = ({ content }: { content: string }) => {
  const cleanContent = DOMPurify.sanitize(content);
  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: cleanContent }} />;
};
// ... existing code ...
```

### Steps to Verify
1. Install `DOMPurify` if not already installed:
   ```bash
   npm install dompurify
   ```

2. Update your component to use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with sanitized content.

3. Test the rendering to ensure the image loads correctly.
