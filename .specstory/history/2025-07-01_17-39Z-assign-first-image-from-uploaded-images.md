how to assign first image from uploadedImages

_**Assistant**_

To assign the first image from `uploadedImages`, you need to ensure that `uploadedImages` is an array (or iterable) and then access its first element. Based on the snippet you provided, it seems `uploadedImages` is being assigned the value of `imageUri`, which might not be an array. Here's how you can modify the code to handle this:

```typescript:frontend-main/src/components/ui/BlogEditor.tsx
// ... existing code ...
      if (!imageUri) {
        uploadedImages = imageUri;
      } else {
        // Ensure uploadedImages is an array and assign the first image
        uploadedImages = Array.isArray(imageUri) ? imageUri[0] : imageUri;
      }
// ... existing code ...
```

### Explanation:
1. **Check if `imageUri` is falsy**: If `imageUri` is `null`, `undefined`, or an empty string, `uploadedImages` is set to `imageUri`.
2. **Handle the case where `imageUri` is truthy**:
   - If `imageUri` is an array, assign the first element (`imageUri[0]`) to `uploadedImages`.
   - If `imageUri` is not an array (e.g., a single string), assign it directly to `uploadedImages`.

This ensures that `uploadedImages` always contains the first image (or the single image) from `imageUri`. Let me know if you'd like further clarification or adjustments!
